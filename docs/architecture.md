# Architecture Notes

## Member B Core And Memory Path

The core implementation is an integration-ready tiled FlashAttention-style
compute path. It is AXI-agnostic: DMA/top provides Q rows and K/V tiles, while
the core returns one normalized O row at a time. The current softmax uses a
deterministic fixed-point exponential approximation so RTL and testbench can be
checked bit-for-bit.

### Core Control Flow

`flash_core` owns the compute-side sequencing and never accesses AXI directly.
It talks to the DMA/top layer through three handshake groups:

- Q row request: `q_req_valid`, `q_req_row`, `q_req_ready`, then `q_data_valid`.
- K/V tile request: `kv_req_valid`, `kv_req_start`, `kv_req_len`, `kv_req_ready`, then `kv_data_valid`.
- O row output: `o_valid`, `o_row`, `o_data`, `o_ready`.

The state machine loads one Q row, walks all K/V tiles with `tile_scheduler`,
computes a serial dot product for every key row in every tile, applies the
causal mask, updates the online softmax state, accumulates weighted V values,
normalizes the accumulator, and emits the complete O row.

### Tile Scheduler

`tile_scheduler` emits `(row_index, kv_start, kv_len)` tuples. With the default
`S_LEN=256` and `BK=16`, it walks each query row across sixteen K/V tiles. The
final tile length is clamped for non-divisible configurations, which makes the
block usable for small tests such as `S_LEN=4`, `BK=2`.

### Dot Product

`dot_product_engine` is a serial signed MAC:

```text
dot = sum(q_vec[d] * k_vec[d]), d = 0 .. D_MODEL-1
```

Inputs and outputs are fixed-point containers, but the module treats them as
signed integers and leaves scaling interpretation to the caller. The product is
sign-extended into a 48-bit accumulator by default.

### Causal Mask

`causal_mask_unit` compares `key_index` against `query_index`. When
`causal_en=1` and `key_index > query_index`, the score is replaced with
`neg_large` and `score_valid` is cleared. Masked scores do not update the
softmax denominator or value accumulator.

### Online Softmax

`online_softmax_engine` updates `(m, l)` for one score at a time:

```text
if first valid score:
    m = score
    l = 1.0
    new_weight = 1.0
elif score > m:
    old_scale = exp_approx(m - score)
    l = l * old_scale + 1.0
    m = score
    new_weight = 1.0
else:
    old_scale = 1.0
    new_weight = exp_approx(score - m)
    l = l + new_weight
```

Weights are Q0.8 values. The current `exp_approx` is a compact deterministic
rational approximation:

```text
exp_approx(delta) = 1.0                         when delta >= 0
exp_approx(delta) = 1.0 / (1.0 + abs(delta))     when delta < 0
```

This is intentionally isolated in one module so it can later be replaced by a
more accurate LUT without changing the core handshake.

### Value Accumulation And Normalization

`value_accumulator` keeps a vector accumulator:

```text
acc[d] = acc[d] * old_scale + new_weight * V[key][d]
```

`normalizer` computes:

```text
O[d] = saturate(acc[d] / l)
```

The accumulator stores `weight_int * V_q8.8`; dividing by the Q0.8 denominator
returns a Q8.8 output integer.

### Buffers

`row_buffer` and `tile_buffer` are synchronous load/hold buffers. The core also
keeps explicit working registers for the currently active Q row, K row, and V
row to keep Icarus-compatible array handling stable.
